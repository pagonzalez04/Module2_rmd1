## R Markdown

### This is a level 3 header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Here is a link to [GOOGLE](http://google.com.mx)

    mean(c(1,2,3,4))

> This is a blockquote. This paragraph has two lines.

> this is another block

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure 2, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
plot(pressure)
```

## Insert Tables

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(cars), caption = "Top 6 rows of Cars Dataset")
```

## Insert and ecuation

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x $$ 

## Insert Images

![sunstar](sunstar.png)

## Insert an Animated GIT and video



## Insert text with footnote

Here is footnote reference [^1] and another [^longnote]

Here is an inline footnote ^[inline notes are easier to write, since you don't have to pick an identified and move downl to type the note]

[^1]: Here is the footnote
[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

## Python code

```{r, setup}
library(reticulate)
matplotlib <- import("matplotlib")
matplotlib$use("Agg", force = TRUE)
plt <- import("matplotlib.pyplot")
```


```{python}
# prints the python configuration
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
df = pd.read_csv('intalaciones.csv', parse_dates=['fechaServicio'])
df2 = df.set_index('fechaServicio').resample('W').count()['numeroServicio'].rolling(4).mean()
```

```{r}
plot(py$df2, type = "o")
```
