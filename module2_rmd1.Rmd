When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure 2, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
plot(pressure)
```

## Insert Tables

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(cars), caption = "Top 6 rows of Cars Dataset")
```

## Insert and ecuation

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x $$ 

## Insert Images

[^1]: Here is the footnote
[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.
